# Blind Minder

Part of my ongoing quest to automate my house.

Blinds open up in the morning to help wake me up and close in the evening before bed.

Most of that's controlled [via HomeKit](https://github.com/apexskier/my-homebridge). A simple
http interface is exposed, and feedback servos allow normal manual control.
